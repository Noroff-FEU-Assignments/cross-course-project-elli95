    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my first website.</p>
    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">[It is important to implement security into the different aspects of the creation/maintenance of the website, and to teach the members of your team security.
        Remember to sanitize the data your system accepts and not to blindly trust data from the browser.
        Encourage the use of strong passwords and potentially two-factor authentication to increase user security.
        Make sure to display only the data that is necessary on the website. When it comes to email, phone numbers, credit card information and other potentially sensitive information, it is important not to show too much information that hackers can use, but enough that the user is able to recognize it.
        With the use of third party application, conduct some research and ensure that the applications used is trusted.
        Preferably, use HTTPS and HSTS as this helps secure data sent between client and servers, and makes it more difficult for hackers to gain information.
        It is also important to test the website for possible weaknesses, and otherwise to regularly run security checks.
        Continuing, you should carry out security exercises that test your security with different fake attacks, this can give you important information about other weaknesses in your system and prepare you for a real attack.
        There is many different security threats out there, as such it is wise to use diverse security measures to help reduce these threats.
        Otherwise, itâ€™s very important to stay up to date with the current security threats, and secure yourself against at least the most common ones.
